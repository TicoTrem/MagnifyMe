# MagnifyMe
Designed to allow users to see things easier using their camera with the ability to zoom, toggle their phones flashlight, and freeze what’s currently being seen through their camera allowing them to see things they normally wouldn’t be able to.
Users can use this app to read text that is too small and in too dark of a room. They can even use it to freeze an image of where you can’t normally see like the back of a TV.
Users can save default settings like zoom and flashlight toggle between app uses, as well as optionally save the frozen image for later use.
